# hello-world
New to the coding world!!
My name is Cody and I'm completely new to all of this. I'm 24 years old and live in Ohio. I was in a car accident 2 years ago and left me an incomplete paraplegic T-12. Through high school I was always into sports, since my accident I have been drawn towards computer engineering and coding.
